# Graphers

Graphers is a GraphQL implementation written in Rust.

Graphers generates Rust code from the proposed GraphQL IDL. Define a Schema
via the IDL, then implement the traits that Graphers generate to create a
complete, compliant GraphQL interface, which you can serve over HTTP.

Graphers is a work in progress, and currently not more than a proof of
concept. It implements only a small subset of the GraphQL spec at this point.
